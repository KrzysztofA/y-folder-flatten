# y-folder-flatten ver 0.9
Easy script to flatten folders with provided nest level 

Uses *Python 3.12*

Nest Level should be minimum 2, initially I thought of it a bit differently and it allows nest level of 1, which will give invalid operation messages as it tries to move folder's content to the same folder. It should skip these though and on nest level 2 it should actually unpack the one level of nest.

## The script **wasn't** tested throughly and you should use it with caution! I do not take responsibility for your files.

All that said I might take some time to fix all the nitty gritty details and improve it at a later time.
