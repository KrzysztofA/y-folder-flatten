# y-folder-flatten ver 0.96
Easy script to flatten folders with provided nest level 

Uses *Python 3.12*

With nest level of minimum 1, simple command line/tkinter app to flatten nested folders up to a provided level.

Tkinter got implemented along with a minor fix. Now it needs to be styled.

## The script **wasn't** tested thoroughly, and you should use it with caution! I do not take responsibility for your files.

All that said I might take some time to fix all the nitty-gritty details and improve it at a later time.

What is to be improved:
- TKInter App Styling
- Tests
- Async execution where applicable
